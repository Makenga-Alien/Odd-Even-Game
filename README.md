# OddEven-Game
# Odd or Even Game

## Description
The and the computer each pick a number from 1 to 10. You add them together. If the total is even, the winner is whoever chose "Even".
If it’s odd, the winner is whoever chose "Odd".

## Caution: 
The game is played between the human (you) and the computer.

### How the Game Works

1. The human player and the computer each choose a number between **1 and 10**.
2. The human player also chooses whether they believe the **sum** of the two numbers will be **Odd** or **Even**.
3. The computer automatically chooses the opposite (if you choose Odd, it picks Even).
4. The numbers are added together, and the game checks if the result is odd or even.
5. The winner of the round is the player whose choice (Odd or Even) matches the sum.
6. This process is repeated for **5 rounds**.
7. After 5 rounds, the game declares the final winner based on the total score.
